# Determination-of-DNA-Methylation-by-Nanopore-Sequencing-as-an-Indicator-of-Age-in-a-Forensic-Context#

Fatih TIRAÅž developed the commands and scripts included in this repository during his doctoral research at the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, University of Dundee. These tools are employed in bioinformatics methods for base calling, processing, and visualizing raw data produced by the current process of DNA methylation, Oxford Nanopore Technology, using four different approaches.
